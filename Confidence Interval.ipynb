    "### Why Confidence Intervals?\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence intervals are a calculated range or boundary around a parameter or a statistic that is supported mathematically with a certain level of confidence.  For example, in the lecture, we estimated, with 95% confidence, that the population proportion of parents with a toddler that use a car seat for all travel with their toddler was somewhere between 82.2% and 87.7%.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is *__different__* than having a 95% probability that the true population proportion is within our confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, if we were to repeat this process, 95% of our calculated confidence intervals would contain the true proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How are Confidence Intervals Calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our equation for calculating confidence intervals is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Best\\ Estimate \\pm Margin\\ of\\ Error$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the *Best Estimate* is the **observed population proportion or mean** and the *Margin of Error* is the **t-multiplier**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-multiplier is calculated based on the degrees of freedom and desired confidence level.  For samples with more than 30 observations and a confidence level of 95%, the t-multiplier is 1.96\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation to create a 95% confidence interval can also be shown as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Population\\ Proportion\\ or\\ Mean\\ \\pm (t\\ multiplier *\\ Standard\\ Error)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the Standard Error is calculated differenly for population proportion and mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Standard\\ Error \\ for\\ Population\\ Proportion = \\sqrt{\\frac{Population\\ Proportion * (1 - Population\\ Proportion)}{Number\\ Of\\ Observations}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Standard\\ Error \\ for\\ Mean = \\frac{Standard\\ Deviation}{\\sqrt{Number\\ Of\\ Observations}}$$"

So keeping in mind that we go from 0.0025 years to 0.1652 years, we seee that both ends of our confidence interval are on the positive side. That mean all the values within the confidence interval are on the positive side. That indicate that with 95 percent confidence we actually expect older twin to ahve had more education since a positive value incidaces that the older twin does have more education. However these values are close to zero so we can say the education level jump for the twin migh not be a huge increase.\n",
