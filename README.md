# Statistical-Analysis
Some work on Statistics in Python which i learned during my certification on Statistics with Python by University of Michigan on Coursera. Its  a good course to start with and there is always something more you can learn.

I also learned how to use latex which was neccesary when you are writing some complex formula in ipynb files.

Further more after a while i have few book on statistics in line like Head first statitics, Bayesian Statistics the fun way.
